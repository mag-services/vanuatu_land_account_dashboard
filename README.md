# Vanuatu Land Cover Accounts Dashboard

A static, client-side React dashboard for Vanuatu land cover statistics (2020–2023).

## GitHub Pages deployment

**Before the deploy workflow runs, you must enable Pages:**

1. Repo → **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**
3. Push to `main`; the workflow will build and deploy

Without this one-time setup, `actions/configure-pages` will fail with "Get Pages site failed".
